<h1>Custom Response from Google Assistant</h1>
I received many requests for<a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/rtRgk9SB-get-custom-responses-from-google-assistant applet for custom responses" target="blank"> Custom responses from Google Assistant</a>. This applet uses filter code(written in typescript) but IFTTT has made them a paid feature now so I can't create them.  The difference was that you wouldn't get any email from the applet unlike others.
<br></br>
I can't even create copies of the applet so I will guide you to manually create one. 
<h2><u>Using IFTTT</u></h2>
<ol>
<li> Log into IFTTT and click on <b>'New Applet'</b> or you may directly <b href="https://ifttt.com/create" target="blank"> Click here.</b>
<li>Tap on <b>'this'</b>.
<li>Search and select <b>'Google Assistant'</b>. 
<li>Next you need to select <b>"Say a simple Phrase"</b>. 
<li>There will be three <b>"What do you want to say"</b> which you must be familiar with and a <b>"What do you want Assistant to say in response?"</b>. Fill them as per your choice. Let the language remain English. 
<li>Fill all those fields and tap on <b>'Create trigger'</b>
<li>Tap on <b>'that'</b>.
<li>Search and Select <b>'WebHooks'</b>.
<li>Tap on <b>'Create web request'</b>. 
<li>Tap on <b>'Connect'</b>.
<li>Select <b>'Make a web request'</b>.
<li>In the URL Field enter any URL or <i>www.google.com </i>. It doesn't matter what URL you use.
<li>Tap on <b>'Create Action'</b>.
<li>Turn off <b>"Receive notifications when this Applet runs"</b> so you won't be getting any  notifications.
<li>Tap on <b>'Finish'</b>.
</ol>
Congratulations, you have created an applet yourself.
Repeat as many times as you want and create multiple custom response applet

<h2><u>Without using IFTTT</u></h2>
<ol>
<li>Open <b>Google app</b>.
<li>Tap the three horizontal bars at bottom right.
<li>Go to <b>'Settings'</b>.
<li>Under Google Assistant. Tap Settings.
<li>Scroll down and select <b>Routines</b>.
<li>Tap <b>'+'</b>
<li>Tap <b>'Add Commands'</b> and Enter what you would like to say to Assistant. 
<li>Tap Ok to save. You may add more ways to say by tapping <b>+</b> on that screen.
<li>Go back and tap <b>'Add action'</b>. 
<li>Tap <b>"Choose popular action"</b>.
<li>Scroll down to <b>Custom Responses</b>. 
<li>Click the check box in front of <b>"Say Something"</b> and then tap setting icon on the right. 
<li>Type the response you want from Assistant. 
<li>Go back and tap <b>'Add'</b> at the top right corner of the screen. 
<li>Tap <b>âœ”(tick icon)</b> on the top right. 
<br>And now you are done. 
</ol>
You may now create multiple custom response applet with or without IFTTT. Have a great day.
